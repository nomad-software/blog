What better way is there to reach other like minded developers than to keep a journal of ideas and thoughts that hopefully will help our community as a whole. Plus, it’s also a storage facility for me, so i don’t forget this stuff!">

<h1 id="javascript-the-good-parts">JavaScript – The Good Parts</h1>
<p><time>Posted on 8th July 2013 by <a href="/pages/about.html">Gary Willoughby</a></time></p>
<p>This is a Google Tech Talk which everyone who’s using Javascript should watch. In this video <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a> explains the good and bad sides to Javascript and highlights very good tips for Javascript development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript is a language with more than its share of bad parts. It went from non-existence to global adoption in an alarmingly short period of time. It never had an interval in the lab when it could be tried out and polished. JavaScript has some extraordinarily good parts. In JavaScript there is a beautiful, highly expressive language that is buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders. The best nature of JavaScript was so effectively hidden that for many years the prevailing opinion of JavaScript was that it was an unsightly, incompetent abomination. This session will expose the goodness in JavaScript, an outstanding dynamic programming language. Within the language is an elegant subset that is vastly superior to the language as a whole, being more reliable, readable and maintainable. – Douglas Crockford</p>
