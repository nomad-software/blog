description: This blog is where i can rant and rave about all the different aspects of software development, save code and ideas for later and somewhere where readers and i can both learn from each other.

Plus, it’s also a storage facility for me, so i don’t forget this stuff!

In my humble opinion, they only need to focus on one thing. Can you guess what it is?
